1.When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Whenever you want to work on a project in a team of dispersed nature (not having the repository on the corporate network, international teams, etc.).
Also if you plan to use the repository form different machines for instance.

2.Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Usually we should commit each logical change in a project. As a large enterprise project can have many commits, it is not a good idea to stay up-to-date automatically (on each commit made to the repository)
as this would be time-consuming and slow.
